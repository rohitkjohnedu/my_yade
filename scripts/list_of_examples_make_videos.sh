# INFO: run this script inside ./scripts
#       It can also be used to check if the examples are working (*1*). Only need to modify line the_examples=…… to use a different grep pattern
#       Then when asked '(Press Ctrl-C when recording is complete) Ready? [y/n] :' press n to skip recording. Then a new example is tested.
#       Also can start more examples simultaneously - just press 'n' to start next one without closing the previous one.

# This script automates creation of videos (*2*) from examples. First it greps list_of_examples for pattern "...│...│no │"
# to identify examples which do not have a video uploaded.
# Then it runs a loop over all those examples. Opens two terminals, in first terminal there is yade running,
# ready to start simulation. In second terminal waits until Ready [y/n] to start recording.
# If 'n' is pressed, then it skips recording.


# this command I used to verify that I got a correct regexp for finding the examples.
